We believe development should be an enjoyable and creative experience. Screenwidth helps take the pain out of development by handling common screen-width-based tasks used in many web projects, such as:

Easy-to-use helper functions
Detect device type based on screen width
Validate specific device types

Screenwidth is accessible, powerful, and a great tool for building large, robust applications.
